# 🤖 2025 LLD Interview Master Guide: The Founding Engineer Edition

> **"The 2025 LLD interview is not a test of UML. It is a test of Engineering Judgment, Concurrency, and AI Collaboration."**

## ⚡ 1. The Core Shift: From "Static" to "Running"
In 2025, you are expected to write **compilable, runnable code** in 30-40 minutes. 

| Feature | 2020 Standard | 2025 Standard (Strong Hire) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | Pseudo-code | **Working Code with Error Handling** |
| **State** | Class Fields | **Atomic References / Concurrent Collections** |
| **Async** | Ignored | **CompletableFutures / Virtual Threads** |
| **Tooling** | Whiteboard | **IDE + Copilot Collaboration** |

## 🏗️ 2. The "AI-Native" Patterns
Design patterns have evolved. During your interview, pivot your scenarios to AI to show you are future-ready:

1.  **Strategy Pattern:** Use it for **LLM Provider Swapping** (OpenAI vs. Anthropic).
2.  **Chain of Responsibility:** Use it for **RAG Pipelines** (Rewriting -> Retrieval -> Generation).
3.  **Adapter Pattern:** Use it for **Vector DB Unification** (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate).
4.  **Observer Pattern:** Use it for **Streaming LLM Responses** to the UI.

## 🔒 3. Concurrency is Non-Negotiable
You MUST handle race conditions explicitly. If the problem is "Ticket Booking" or "AI Task Queue":
*   **Junior:** Uses `synchronized` (Slow).
*   **Senior:** Uses **Optimistic Locking** (Version numbers) or **ConcurrentHashMap**.
*   **Founding Engineer:** Uses **Redis Distributed Locks** for cross-node concurrency.

## 💡 4. "Vibe Coding": How to use AI in the Interview
If the interviewer allows Copilot, they are watching your **Architectural Direction.**

*   **Step 1:** Define the **Interfaces** and **Models** manually. This shows you own the design.
*   **Step 2:** Prompt the AI for the **Boilerplate** (e.g., "Generate a standard DTO for this model").
*   **Step 3:** Manually write the **Concurrency and Pattern logic**. 
*   **The Pro-Tip:** Catch the AI's mistakes. Say: *"The AI generated a simple ArrayList here, but for our 10k user scale, I'm refactoring this to a CopyOnWriteArrayList to prevent race conditions."* (This is a 10/10 hire move).

## ✅ 2025 Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Can you implement a **Thread-Safe Singleton** in < 2 mins?
- [ ] Do you know how to build a **Rate Limiter** for LLM Tokens?
- [ ] Can you explain **Double Dispatch** (Visitor) in the context of a code analyzer?
- [ ] Have you practiced a **Machine Coding** challenge with a 90-min timer?
