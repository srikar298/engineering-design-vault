/**
 * <h1>Stage 1a: Naive Lazy Initialization (❌ Thread Unsafe)</h1>
 * 
 * This is the most basic implementation of a Singleton.
 * It delays creation of the instance until it is actually needed (Lazy Init).
 * 
 * <p><b>The Flaw:</b> In a multi-threaded environment, if Thread A and Thread B 
 * both evaluate `instance == null` at the exact same time, they will BOTH 
 * create a new instance of the PaymentGateway. The Singleton guarantee is broken.
